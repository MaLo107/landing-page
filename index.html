                    <p>After graduating high school, I was accepted into the Clark Scholars at UVA. 
                        This experience has provided me so many things as I have been with this group from the beginning. Firstly, I was able 
                        to go to gorunds during that summer before the semester started to get a feel for it. They then allowed us to take
                        classes while we were there to get a head start. Most importantly, I lived and shared multiple momnets with my
                        cohort whom I love to be around and continue this journey we started together a little over 2 years ago.</p>

                    <h3>KPMG Embark Scholar Intern</h3>
                    <p>I was accepted to be an intern at KPMG, through their Embark Scholars Program. I am currently working on multiple engagements
                    within the realm of information systems (IT) and software engineering. I have also met and worked with big companies
                    like T.Rowe Price and Appian. I have enjoyed learning and growing with every team I've been on and hope to continue 
                    growing as I look to advance in my career!
